# Matrices__Operations__SLE__Det
<span>This is my control work of higher mathematics.<br/>
This project can count<br/></span>
<ul>
  <li>determinate</li>
  <li>multiply matrices</li>
  <li>multiply matrix by number</li>
  <li>sum of matrices</li>
  <li>operations</li>
  <li>reverse matrix</li>
  <li>systems of line equaintance by Gausse's method</li>
</ul><br/>
<span>All of these ready-made methods, that you can insert into your program for your task (  or your control work :)  )<br/>
To see code you need to move to "Matrices__Operations__SLE__Det/Matrices/Program.cs" I recommend to copy the code in your visual studio for a better understanding</span><br/>
